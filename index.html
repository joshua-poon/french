      <h2>Why learn French?</h2>


      <p>French is a good language to learn as a second language. Here are some syntactical reasons why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It possesses many properties of foreign languages: conjugations, genders, stricter word order. You
          understand
          the different tenses and how they can be used.</li>
        <li>You understand the fact that there is no such thing as 'word to word' translation, but sometimes, whole
          meanings
          needs
          to be translated together. </li>
        <li>Differing word order such as noun-adjective, which are also transferable to other languages including
          English
          compound nouns of French origin</li>

        <li>Analysing the syntactic structure of a sentence becomes second nature, as it is one ofthe methods of
          thorough translation. Understanding concepts such as singular vs polite forms of a pronoun.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Also, the vocabulary is useful in a number of ways.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly, being able to see connections with the English language, its similarities, which is a method of
          memorising vocabulary which I will delve into.</li>
        <li>how it has influenced the etymology of many English words, especially concepts such as words with different
          levels of prestige based on their Romantic roots</li>

      </ul>

      <p> Pronunciation of French words is a whole nother game. I'll also be looking into this, but I can't say that I
        am knowledgeable in the evolution of the pronunciation of French words, from its roots within regional dialects
        across France and as a form of 'corrupted' Latin, to modern French as determined by the Académie Française.</p>
