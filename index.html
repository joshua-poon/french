  <h2>Why learn French?</h2>

  <p>French is a good language to learn as a second language. It possesses many properties of foreign languages:
    conjugations, genders, stricter word order. You understand the different tenses and how they can be used. You
    understand the fact that there is no such thing as 'word to word' translation, but sometimes, whole meanings needs
    to be translated together. Differing word order such as noun-adjective, which are also transferable to other
    languages. Analysing the syntactic structure of a sentence becomes second nature, as it is one ofthe methods of
    thorough translation. Understanding concepts such as singular vs polite forms of a pronoun. Finally, the vocabulary
    of the French language is quite useful in a number of ways. Firstly, being able to see connections with the English
    language, its similarities, how it has influenced it and the etymology of many English words, especially concepts
    such as words with different levels of prestige based on their Romantic roots etc. etc.</p>
  <p> Pronunciation of French words is a whole nother game. I'll also be looking into this, but in terms of the
    evolution of French pronunciation, I can't say that I am that knowledgeable in that area.</p>
