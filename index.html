  <h2>Why learn French?</h2>

  <p>French is a good language to learn as a second language. Here are some syntactical reasons why:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It possesses many properties of foreign languages: conjugations, genders, stricter word order. You understand
      the different tenses and how they can be used.</li>
    <li>You understand the fact that there is no such thing as 'word to word' translation, but sometimes, whole meanings
      needs
      to be translated together. </li>
    <li>Differing word order such as noun-adjective, which are also transferable to other languages including English
      compound nouns of French origin</li>

    <li>Analysing the syntactic structure of a sentence becomes second nature, as it is one ofthe methods of
      thorough translation. Understanding concepts such as singular vs polite forms of a pronoun.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Also, the vocabulary is useful in a number of ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firstly, being able to see connections with the English language, its similarities, which is a method of
      memorising vocabulary which I will delve into.</li>
    <li>how it has influenced the etymology of many English words, especially concepts such as words with different
      levels of prestige based on their Romantic roots</li>

  </ul>

  <p> Pronunciation of French words is a whole nother game. I'll also be looking into this, but in terms of the
    evolution of French pronunciation, I can't say that I am that knowledgeable in that area.</p>
